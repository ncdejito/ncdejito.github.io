Hello! I am Niccolo ðŸ‘‹

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with experience deploying machine learning models in production to both cloud and resource-constrained environments. I have had the privilege to contribute to several domains: product dev, tech consulting, telco, and finance, spanning multiple domains in software engineering and data science. I am proud of my technical skills in `systems engineering`, with my continued pursuit of technology-agnostic solution creation. My research interests are physical AI, climate robotics, and labor automation. I build technology to better understand peopleâ€”how the digital systems we create are shaped by our needs and behaviors.
