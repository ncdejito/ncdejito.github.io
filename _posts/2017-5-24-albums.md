#### Goal
Suggest albums similar to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
#### Data
Allmusic.com moods
#### Insights
List of albums to try

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/ncdejito/albums.png">

I created a recommendation algorithm for music albums based on moods from Allmusic.com. Each mood was represented as an adjective like Ambitious, Flashy, Bombastic. Each column is a mood, while each row is an album. Each mood is one-hot encoded. To find an album similar to the album you like,
1. Get moods for album you like
1. Encode moods as 1, 0 valued columns.
1. Find similar albums using cosine similarity and one-hot encoded albums.
Result would be something similar to the image above, where the first row is the album I put as input.
