I discuss what I have been up to these past few months. Play this for [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAdKyuGRLWY).

My last company shut down its robotics department in my country last May. It was my dream job. Luckily, I have been able to stay afloat given some opportunities forwarded by my network that I am grateful to have. Now I would like to move forward with the next chapter of my life.

#### Since May I have..

<ul>
    <li>Gone to Tokyo - first solo trip ever!</li>
    <li>Provided an actionable AI roadmap for a local company with no da</li>
    <li>Provided integration support for an AI adoption project for an American development org</li>
    <li>Finished my A1 German class - learning a language is very fun</li>
    <li>Gone to Osaka - family trip hurray traveling with kids is fun and annoying</li>
</ul>

#### Here's what is lined up for me

<ul>
    <li>Going to Taiwan - never been but hopefully not the last time!</li>
    <li>Taking AWS SAA exam - I'd like to learn system design as that is what I enjoyed from my last role</li>
    <li>Starting my online Masters program - accepted thanks to the recommendation of my Dyson colleagues!</li>
    <li>Taking German A1 exam - aiming for Chancenkarte</li>
    <li>Continually looking for my next opportunity</li>
</ul>

I am glad to have things to do even during a tight job market, and I hope I find my next job before my savings runs out. I am glad I saved up so I have some runway. The industry I picked (robotics) is really risky and having experienced what it is like to have this very unique job in a country that does not have the industry, it is quite a cost that I have paid abandoning more lucrative paths that I would have been good at if I stuck with it. It is a cost I have paid and I do not regret learning how to program robots at all. I do not know what the future holds but I am hoping through movement I find a better outcome than my current trajectory. Time to see!

Here is a quote I keep coming back to in moments of drastic changes:

> Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."
> Say not, "I have found the path of the soul." Say rather, "I have met the soul walking upon my path."
> For the soul walks upon all paths.
> The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.
> The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.
> —Kahlil Gibran
