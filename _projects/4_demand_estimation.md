Project context: [External blogpost](https://stories.thinkingmachin.es/wealth-detection-satellite-image/)
* A comparable project as above but with larger regional provider, anonymized to preserve client identity.

Personal contributions:
* Built, trained, and deployed `ML` models rolled out to 50+ GB worth of satellite images to generate previously unknowable and infeasible to collect data, saving $15/sqkm vs commercial API for regional telco client;
* Surpassed critical usability threshold for an AI model for a international telecommunications client, by enhancing accuracy by 13% through error analysis and novel `graph-based` solution;
* Achieved acceptance criteria for enterprise ML CV project, allowing on-time project delivery, by successfully `negotiating` image-based error-correction web-app feature with client;
* Rolled out ML model on 50+ GB worth of satellite images in 2 hours by distributing compute on 40 VMs via `GCP` DataFlow, vs usual 2 days on 1 machine to ensure on-time delivery;
* Reduced rollout runtime by 2mins, by optimizing graph calculation with cached hashmap;
* Productionalized `SQL` pipeline with automated data quality checks via DataForm;
* Automated static analysis, profiling and test coverage for ML `APIs`;
* Prototyped building classification model, including modifying `PyTorch` layers to enable fusion of image and tabular features to one model;
* Developed and productionalized object detection data product, saving $15/sqkm for client rollout instead of using a commercial API;
* Developed and productionalized building height prediction model, saving $59/sqkm for client rollout;
* Implemented a graph-based model feature for building use classification model, used in final rollout version;
* Taught fundamental ML/DL to external clients, contributing good relationship for return engagement;
