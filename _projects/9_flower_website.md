2025 update: still being used and making money

I got the really cool rose as a bonus from a client on a part-time gig! Here are the things I did:

To make the client happy, I delivered on what they asked:
* Automated raw material planning and delivery charge calculation, providing clarity and basis for critical business decisions;
* Optimized operational dashboard from 19s latency to <1s, zero downtime during high-traffic holidays;
* Saved 200h of manpower time monthly by automating audit procedures, reducing daily 4h audit routine to 2min;

I also delivered extra stuff they ended up liking:
* Deployed and developing store website (https://lnkd.in/gHXYnHtX), to fully automate order checkout and payment that currently takes ~1 day manual work to confirm;
* Lock-in off-hour orders and manage unsustainable volume of queries by developing a custom chatbot (..Behavior Trees??!);
* Scoped and developing delivery dispatching distributed system with live tracking, proof of delivery and overview map with route tracking;

I’m privileged to be connected with a forward-thinking entrepreneur (disclosure: he's my cousin-in-law). Sharing on linkedin for proof of life, hello colleagues I’m ok! Hope you’re doing great!! 😄 Stay strong friends, and kudos to those successfully managing to hold up their part of the world! 戦え!!
