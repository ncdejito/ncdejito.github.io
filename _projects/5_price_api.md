Project context: https://stories.thinkingmachin.es/how-ohmyhome-used-machine-learning-for-real-estate-valuation/

Personal contributions:
* Led development of 3 backend APIs serving ML models for real estate price prediction, leading to extended client engagement with 2 more APIs, by following `MLOps` best practices and `CI/CD` with Kubernetes;
* Owned the development of 5 ML models for real estate pricing, while also serving as primary on-call for the 5 APIs on `Kubernetes` CI/CD, operating across different markets for an international client;
* Reduced recurring GCP storage costs by optimizing ML output file size by an order of 10;
* Reduced latency per ML API call by 3s, by caching data for queries on GCP `BigQuery`;
* Configured access for team members with `GCP` IAM and K8s RBAC;
* Handled data ingestion, process and monitoring `data pipelines` for weekly model retraining;
