Project context: [External blogpost](https://stories.thinkingmachin.es/mapping-new-informal-settlements/)

For my contributions, I was privileged to be granted primary authorship of the following 2 papers, which got accepted into the globally recognized conference `NeurIPS`.
* [2021 NeurIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04134) Primary author for Mapping Access to Water and Sanitation using Publicly Accessible Satellite Imagery;
* [2020 NeurIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13583) Primary author for Mapping New Informal Settlements Using Machine Learning and Satellite Images;

Personal contributions:
* Pioneered the use of Google Earth Engine for data extraction, ingestion and processing;
* Helped direct foreign aid in crisis-stricken Colombia, by making previously impossible satellite analysis feasible with AI, with 2 co-authored NeurIPS papers: detection, prediction;
* Owned the development of a satellite image prediction model that produced 250 m resolution maps over a 300K sqkm land area;
* Led meetings with international clients across different time zones such as ET, UTC8;
